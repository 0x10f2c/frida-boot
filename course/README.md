# Frida Boot ðŸ‘¢

Welcome to Frida Boot! A binary instrumentation workshop, using [frida](https://frida.re/), for beginners!

I hope that this workshop gets you excited about using Frida, and can accelerate your learning to go from wondering about, to crafting your spoils! "WTF" to "IDKFA".

## What you will not learn

This workshop will **not** cover the widly popular mobile application uses of Frida. Instead, the idea is to teach the core concepts that can be applied to any runtime (albeit with their naunces) that Frida supports.

## Using this documentation

If you are not already doing so, make sure you browse to the port exposed by the docker container to view this documentation.

Please see [starting](0-getting-started/starting) for information on starting the container.

## Ready for the next step
