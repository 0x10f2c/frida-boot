# LD_PRELOAD

Before we get our hands dirty with Frida, let's take a detour and implement some hooking ourselves. We will do this by making use of the Linux `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. From `man ld.so` we can read about this variable (and its many, many friends):

```text
LD_PRELOAD
    A list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared objects to be loaded  
    before all others. This feature can be used to selectively override  
    functions in other shared objects.
```

Basically, what that means is that we can build our own shared library and specify it with the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variale to be loaded when our program starts up. Our shared object can contain a function that already exists in another shared object, and our's will get preference when called.

Under the hood, when a call to something like `printf` is made for the first time, the C standard library actually dynamically resolves the address of where the code for `printf` really lives. It is possible to avoid this behaviour by compiling an executable with the `-static` flag, meaning all of the logic will be contained in the executable without any external dependencies. The `ldd` tool can be used to see which libraries an exectuable depends on.

```bash
# Dynamic executable
$ gcc example.c -o example
$ ldd example
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe411c3000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4990592000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4990760000)

# Static executable
$ gcc -static example.c -o example # note the -static flag
$ ldd example
    not a dynamic executable
```

When a dynamic executable encouters a function like `printf` for the first time, the libraries in the output of `ldd` will be searched for a function with that name. When we specify the `LD_PRELOAD` variable, we add a new library to that list that will be serached _before_ those in the list shown with `ldd`. Pretty cool eh.

## Excercise

Let's see this in action. To play with `LD_PRELOAD`, we will first write a quick example program. The following snippet can be copied into a new file, calling it `sleep_test.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
// 1

int main() {

    printf("[+] Starting up!\n");

    int t = 3;

    while(1) {
        printf("[+] Sleeping for %d seconds\n", t);
        // 2
    }
}
```

If you were to compile that program now, you should just have an infinite loop that does not sleep. Regardless, lets compile it just to check that everything works. Run:

```bash
gcc sleep_test.c -o sleep_test
```

You should see now new output after hitting enter, but instead should have a new binary in the local directory called `sleep_test`. Running it should just print _Sleeping for 3 seconds_ forver.

```text
$ ./sleep_test
[+] Starting up!
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds

[...]
```

Kill the program with `ctrl + c`.

## Actually sleeping

Let's introduce the sleep. To know which headers we may need, as well as which arguments `sleep()` would need (if any), we can refer to the man pages again. Check out the `sleep()` man page with `man 3 sleep`.

```text
SLEEP(3)    Linux Programmer's Manual   SLEEP(3)

NAME
       sleep - sleep for a specified number of seconds

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);

DESCRIPTION
       sleep() causes the calling thread to sleep either until the number of real-time seconds specified in seconds have elapsed or until a signal arrives which is not ignored.
```

?> The `3` refers to the manual page section we want. Section 3 is typically for library functions from the C standard library.

The `SYNOPSIS` sectin tells us exactly which headers to include in our program, and what the function signature for `sleep()` is. Add this to your program now.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {

    printf("[+] Starting up!\n");

    int t = 3;

    while(1) {
        printf("[+] Sleeping for %d seconds\n", t);
        sleep(t);
    }
}
```

Next, recompile your program by running the `gcc` command again. It should _actually_ sleep for the `3` seconds we hard coded the time. But what if we wanted to change that 3 seconds? Well, our one option is to change the source code and make it whatever the new value should be. Then, recompile and test. Or, we can use a shared library with `LD_PRELOAD`.

Here comes the fun part! ðŸŽ‰

## Shared libraries

The man page for `ld.so`, explaining the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable says we need to use a shared library for this, so lets build one ouselves. Using the man page in the previous section as reference, we need to implement _exactly_ the same function signature in our library. So, create a new file called `fake_sleep.c` and implement the new and improved `sleep()` function. For now, we will just print a string indicating that out sleep was called! (_Hint:_ Get the function signature/heads from `man 3 printf`).

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// man 3 sleep
//  unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);
unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds) {

    // you've never slept the well in your life!
    printf("[-] sleep goes brrr\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Compiling a shared library is a _little_ different to a normal program. This time round we need to give `gcc` some new flags indicating that we want Position Independant Code (PIC) and more specifically a `shared` library. With that in mind we can compile the shared library with:

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared fake_sleep.c -o fake_sleep.so
```

?> *Note* The output file name ends with an `.so`. `LD_PRELOAD` will ignore files that do not end with that extention.

With our shared library implementing `sleep()` ready, its time to hook the real `sleep()`! Do that with `LD_PRELOAD=./fake_sleep.so ./sleep_test`.

?> By running `LD_PRELOAD=./lib.so ./program`, we are specifying the `LD_PRELOAD` value for this run only. You can change that to be for any program started in the current shell with `export LD_PRELOAD=./lib.so`. Alternatively, if you have a library you want to be preloaded with any program, you can add a line to `/etc/ld.so.preload` (which can be pretty dangerous!).

```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=./fake_sleep.so ./sleep_test
[+] Starting up!
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds

[...]
```

## Detours

You may not always want to completely replace a function though. Instead, you may want to just add some logging to a function call to sniff arguments for example, just like a detour on your way somewhere nice. In that case, we will need to update the shared library to actually call the _real_ sleep once we are done with what we want to do.

!> This is a bit of a more advanced topic. Don't stress if everything isn't perfectly clear.

With our shared library overriding the call to `sleep()`, we need to figure out where the real `sleep()` is if we want to make use of it. One way to do that is call `dlsym` to dynamically try and determine the address of a symbol (in our case the real `sleep()`). With the address, we can proceed to call the original `sleep()` directly, without relying on the linker to resolve it. So how do we call `dlsym()`? `man 3 dlsym`!

```text
DLSYM(3)    Linux Programmer's Manual   DLSYM(3)

NAME
       dlsym, dlvsym - obtain address of a symbol in a shared object or executable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dlfcn.h>

       void *dlsym(void *handle, const char *symbol);
```

Seems simple enough but truthfully, its a bit more tricky than that and you are better off reading the larger man page to understand the intrcrecies of how `dlym` works. For the purposes of this excercise though, its just important to know that a handle to the real function should be created, and that handle should be resolved with `dlsym`.

One last thing, lets update the sleep to just sleep for `1` second in the library, and not for the amount of time that is actually requestes. With all that coming together, our `fake_sleep.c` detour should now look something like:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

// man 3 sleep
//  unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);
unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds) {

    // you've never slept the well in your life!
    printf("[-] sleep goes brrr\n");

    seconds = 1;

    unsigned int (*original_sleep)(unsigned int);
    original_sleep = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "sleep");

    return (original_sleep)(seconds);
}
```

We are almost there! The last step would be to recompile our shared library, but because we are going to lookup symbols at runtime, we should also link a dynamic linker, `libdl`. It's a mouthful I know, but all that means is you need to add the `-ldl` flag at the end of your `gcc` command. For example:

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared fake_sleep.c -o fake_sleep.so -ldl
```

Thats it! Run the program again with the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable set and watch as the three second sleep becomes only one second, with a nice message.

```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=./fake_sleep.so ./sleep_test
[+] Starting up!
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr
[+] Sleeping for 3 seconds
[-] sleep goes brrr

[ ... actually sleeps for 1 second ... ]
```

Neat! You have just build a shared library that creates a detour for the `sleep()` function, logging when its invoked and altering the time to sleep to `1` second. All without touching the source code of the original program.
